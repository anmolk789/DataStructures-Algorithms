Tower-of-Hanoi

The tower of Hanoi is a mathematical puzzle. It consists of three rods, and a number of disks of different sizes which can slide onto any rod. The puzzle starts with the disks in a neat stack in ascending order of size on one rod, the smallest at the top. We have to obtain the same stack on the third rod.  Assume the maximum number of disks to be 6. Display Invalid input for the given input less than zero or greater than 6.
Write a program in Java to solve Tower-of-Hanoi using recursion.

Note: Write the main() inside the class 'TowerTest'

Sample Input and Output :
